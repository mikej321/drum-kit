# drum-kit

My attempt at learning DOM manipulation through doing a drum kit. Some of the things that I learned through this project have been interesting. They include....


1. The audio tag and how it works with javascript via tags and properties

2. data attributes i.e. custom attributes

3. toggle function

4. event listeners

5. The 'this' keyword and subsequently, through trial and error, I learned that ES6 Arrow Functions do NOT work with This due to arrow functions not being tied to the 'this' keyword and instead being tied to the lexical scope.
